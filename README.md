# README

This is where I save the web pages that I developed as development tools or for experimentations.

This project contains the following pages:
1. Home page with links to the other pages + a widget indicating Tomcat status (with applications state) + a widget indicating ElasticSearch status (with stats on indexes and plugins)
..* Unfortunately, this page was lost before due to a bad manipulation :(
1. ESSM monitoring app: used to demonstrate the "admin status" SelfService REST API. Used during a sprint review
1. Eptica API LL app: used to call Eptica Server API LL (XML API), with syntax highlighting on both request and response
1. Eptica Chat client page: used as client page for Vivocha (a Vivocha JS script is loaded with this page, the corresponding Vivocha instance is displayed). Also used to generate the URL to use for the Vivocha "onBehalfOf" login API
1. ELS test app: used to play with ELS search API and some of its parameters
1. Experimentations: used to try things in HTML, CSS and/or Javascript
1. Swagger UI: branded with Eptica colors and logo. Also has a predefined list of APIs entrypoints (some of Snowball APIs)
1. Web Speech API: experimentations around the Web Speech API
